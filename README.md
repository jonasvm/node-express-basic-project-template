# Node basic project template using Express and EJS
This is only a template for a basic Node JS project, that uses Express and EJS. Once Node JS doesnt have a CLI program to generate basic project structures (like Angular CLI), this template helps in this way.

Note: Inside the folder public, there are two more folders, not created because they are empty. The folders are javascripts and images.
